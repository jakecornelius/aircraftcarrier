        <h2>From Battleships to Aircraft Carriers: The Evolution of US Naval Doctrine</h2>
        <img class="center" src="https://media.defense.gov/2016/Oct/16/2001648409/-1/-1/0/161014-N-OI810-2398.JPG" alt="Aircraft Carrier Replacing Battleship" width="800">
        <p>The rise of the aircraft carrier marked a major shift in US Naval Doctrine, with the gradual replacement of battleships as the centerpiece of naval strategy. This transition was driven by several factors.</p>
        <p>World War II demonstrated the effectiveness of aircraft carriers. Carriers proved to be more versatile and capable of projecting power over greater distances compared to battleships. Iconic battles like the Battle of Midway showcased the decisive role played by carrier-based aircraft in naval engagements.</p>
        <p>Additionally, advancements in aviation technology, such as the development of faster and more capable aircraft, further solidified the importance of carriers in modern naval warfare. These aircraft could deliver precision strikes against enemy targets with greater speed and accuracy than traditional naval artillery.</p>
        <p>As a result of these developments, the US Navy gradually shifted its focus towards carrier-centric naval doctrines, emphasizing power projection, air superiority, and expeditionary warfare. Today, aircraft carriers remain the cornerstone of US Naval Doctrine, reflecting the enduring legacy of their transformative impact on naval warfare.</p>
