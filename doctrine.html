        <h2>From Battleships to Aircraft Carriers: The Evolution of US Naval Doctrine</h2>
        <img class="center" src="https://media.defense.gov/2016/Oct/16/2001648409/-1/-1/0/161014-N-OI810-2398.JPG" alt="Aircraft Carrier Replacing Battleship" width="800">
        <p>The rise of the aircraft carrier marked a major shift in US Naval Doctrine, with the gradual replacement of battleships as the centerpiece of naval strategy. This transition was driven by several factors.</p>
        <p>Prior to the emergence of aircraft carriers, naval doctrine revolved around battleships as the backbone of naval power projection. Battleships, with their firepower and armored hulls, were regarded as the center of naval supremacy, capable of engaging enemy fleets in surface battles. Meanwhile, cruisers served as scouts and escorts, providing reconnaissance and protection for the capital ships. 
        <p>However, this doctrine had inherent limitations that became apparent with the growth of airpower.</p>
        <p>Advancements in aviation technology, such as the development of faster and more capable aircraft, further solidified the importance of carriers in modern naval warfare. These aircraft could deliver precision strikes against enemy targets with greater speed and accuracy than traditional naval artillery.</p>
        <p>As a result of these developments, the US Navy gradually shifted its focus towards carrier-centric naval doctrines, emphasizing power projection, air superiority, and expeditionary warfare. Today, aircraft carriers remain the cornerstone of US Naval Doctrine.</p>
