        <p>The Battle of Leyte Gulf, which occurred from October 23 to 26, 1944, was one of the largest naval battles in history and a decisive engagement in the Pacific Theater of World War II. It was fought between the Allied forces, primarily the United States Navy, and the Imperial Japanese Navy.</p>
        <p>During the battle, the US employed its aircraft carriers with great effectiveness, utilizing carrier-based aircraft to launch coordinated attacks on Japanese naval forces. The carriers served as the cornerstone of the US Navy's offensive capabilities, enabling it to project air power over vast distances and dominate the skies.</p>
        <p>The Battle of Leyte Gulf ultimately resulted in a decisive victory for the Allied forces, dealing a significant blow to the Japanese Navy and further weakening Japan's ability to defend its territories in the Pacific. It highlighted the pivotal role of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare and solidified their importance in future military operations.</p>
