        <p>The Japanese were looking to take Port Moresby in New Guinea to establish air bases.
        <p>The Battle of Coral Sea showcased the strategic importance of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare. Both the US and Japanese navies relied heavily on carrier-based aircraft for reconnaissance, air cover, and offensive strikes.</p>
        <p>Not a single surface ship fired at each other which established the carrier warfare that would be define the Pacific. The US Navy's aircraft carriers, including the USS Lexington and USS Yorktown, played a pivotal role in the battle. The Lexington was ultimately sunk and the Yorktown was heavily damaged.</p>
        <p>Although the United States suffered heavy losses, so did the Japanese Navy. The Japanese were halted and the battle resulted in a strategic victory for the United States.</p>
