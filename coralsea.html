        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought from May 4-8, 1942, was a significant naval engagement between the United States and Imperial Japanese forces during World War II. It was the first naval battle in history where opposing fleets engaged without ever sighting each other directly.</p>

        <h2>Employment of Carriers</h2>
        <p>The Battle of Coral Sea showcased the strategic importance of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare. Both the US and Japanese navies relied heavily on carrier-based aircraft for reconnaissance, air cover, and offensive strikes.</p>
        <p>The US Navy's aircraft carriers, including the USS Lexington and USS Yorktown, played a pivotal role in the battle. Carrier-based aircraft conducted airstrikes on enemy vessels, disrupting Japanese plans and preventing a potential invasion of Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea.</p>
        <p>The battle demonstrated the effectiveness of carrier-based air power in engaging enemy forces over vast distances and protecting vital strategic interests. Despite sustaining losses, the US Navy's innovative use of carriers proved instrumental in securing a strategic victory and halting the Japanese advance in the Pacific theater.</p>
