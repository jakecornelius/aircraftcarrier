        <h2>Center of US Naval Doctrine</h2>
        <img src="naval_doctrine_image.jpg" alt="Aircraft Carrier" width="600">
        <p>Following World War II, aircraft carriers became the cornerstone of US Naval Doctrine. The devastating success of carrier-based operations in the Pacific theater highlighted the unparalleled strategic value of aircraft carriers in projecting power across vast distances.</p>
        <p>The US Navy recognized the versatility and effectiveness of aircraft carriers, leading to the development of carrier battle groups and power projection strategies. Carrier battle groups, consisting of aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and support vessels, became the primary tool for projecting American military power worldwide.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the advent of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, such as the USS Enterprise and the Nimitz-class carriers, further solidified the aircraft carrier's role as the centerpiece of US Naval Doctrine. These carriers provided unmatched endurance and capability, allowing for sustained operations in any theater of operations.</p>
        <p>Today, the presence of aircraft carriers remains a symbol of American military strength and global influence. They continue to shape geopolitical dynamics and serve as indispensable assets in safeguarding national security interests.</p>
