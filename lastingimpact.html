        <p>Technological advancements propelled the evolution of aircraft carriers following WWII. The introduction of jet-powered aircraft and the development of angled flight decks and steam catapults enhanced the carriers' capabilities, enabling them to launch and recover aircraft more efficiently. These advancements increased the range, speed, and striking power of carrier-based aircraft.</p>
        <p>During the Korean War, aircraft carriers played a crucial role in providing air support for ground operations and conducting airstrikes against enemy targets. The Cold War era saw aircraft carriers play a pivotal role in shaping geopolitical dynamics and deterring potential adversaries. The presence of aircraft carriers in the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 for example, as a deterrence strategy demonstrated the carrier's versatility. 
	    <p>With escalating tensions in the Pacific with China, the United States has stated its commitment to upholding freedom of navigation in the region. Central to this strategy is the deployment of aircraft carriers as a visible symbol of American naval power and a critical tool for deterring potential aggression.
